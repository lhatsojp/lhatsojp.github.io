            On the corner of Greenpoint Ave and 40th street is a small Romanian bakery hidden by a Papa-Johns. Although Cofetaria Nita is both literally and physically behind the bigger restaurants in the area, it still represents the importance of community in the ever-changing neighborhood of Sunnyside, Queens.

            One year for my birthday my parents got me a cake that looked like a porcupine. The cake had little chocolate spikes and a cream face. To the younger me, I was both confused and happy. 1. How do you make a cake that looks like a Porcupine? and 2. How does it taste so good? Although I didn't know it at the time, the cake was from Cofetrai Nita. However, every time I would go back to Cofetria Nita I be surprised at how it looked, it stayed the same. Around Christmas time, a few extra lights would go up, and around Halloween, some pumpkins and things would as well. Yet whenever I went in the day before my birthday or passed by on a run, I always thought about how little I actually knew about it.

            To be specific, the front of the store has a brown sign hanging over the top with the name Cofetria Nita and a cream-colored cake as its symbol. The brown isn't an off-putting color but instead a pastel color that embodies its warm and welcoming atmosphere. The building of the bakery, in pure Queens fashion, is made from red bricks that have slowly chipped away over the years. Kids crash their bikes, old ladies bump their carts filled with groceries, and rain erodes the cement.

            The cakes and pastries, in contrast, made by the women in red aprons, have not changed. Through the rounded glass case, cakes and cupcakes line the shelves varying in size and color from sprinkle cookies to chocolate-dipped cookies costing only 50 cents, these sweets have been the same since the beginning. Yet it's the sweet smell of strawberry cream and warm coffee leaves that permeates the air of the bakery that leaves the buyer spending a little more than they intended to.

            What you will find when you enter is someone enjoying their coffee and pastry at the single table and 2 chairs that the place can hold. Although most people come and go, not knowing if they will come back. What they do know is that in an everchanging Sunnyside, Cofetria Nita will always be there. For example, the Allstate across the street is new by about a year or 2 and some of the restaurants around the corner have been newly renovated due to new owners. The Papa Johns's has probably been renovated at least 3 times in the past 15 years and yet it's still in business oddly enough.

            A year or two ago I moved to a new neighborhood and within a couple of blocks from my apartment, there are 2 malls and many residential buildings. The streets are loud and filled with bustling shoppers as cars drive through with their building-shaking music. The streets are no longer quiet with the sounds of rustling trees or the laughter of kids from the park across Cofetaria Nita. I may be in another neighborhood, but that's when I realized Cofetaria Nita was never just a place, but a symbol and beacon of what community can bring to one's life.
